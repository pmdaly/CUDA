CUDA Reference
===
This repo is mostly meant to be a reference so I can quickly look up how to
implement parallel versions of common algorithms or techniques.

The files are not standalone programs, they are meant to be added
and updated to your application.

Currently there's no commenting as I'm quickly rewriting this code, but I'll
update this slowly along the way.
